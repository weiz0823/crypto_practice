## File system

Use `ls -R` to check the file system.

- `src/` should include source code of the library.
- `scripts/` includes scripts used to do repetitive work.
- `tests/` includes test files. They are not compiled when compiling the library.

## Code standard

- Abiding by
  [Google C++ Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
  is encouraged.
